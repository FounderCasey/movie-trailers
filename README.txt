**HOW TO USE**


Open up your cmd or terminal and open it to the location it is saved

Example: >>>cd Desktop\FreshTomatoes

Once the cmd or terminal is set to that destination input the following line:

python entertainment_center.py



**WEB APP FUNCTIONALITY**


Once you are using the web app you have access to all of those trailers
by simply clicking the poster image.


**TROUBLESHOOTING**


Once you tell the cmd or terminal to run entertainment_center.py a web
browser should open, however if a web browser does not open do this:

Navigate to the folder the files are in, there will be a "fresh_tomatoes.html"
file. 

Now you have two options:

1: Right click > open with > FireFox/Chrome/IE/etc..

2: Drag file to your web browser and it will launch the file.
